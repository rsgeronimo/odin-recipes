    <h2>Description</h2>
    To make a delicious pizza, start by preparing the dough. In a mixing bowl, combine 2 ½ cups of all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons of instant yeast, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and 1 teaspoon of salt. Gradually add 1 cup of warm water and 2 tablespoons of olive oil to the dry ingredients, mixing until a soft dough forms. Knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Allow it to rise in a warm place for about an hour until it doubles in size. Once the dough has risen, preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). Roll out the dough into your desired pizza shape and thickness, then transfer it to a baking sheet or pizza stone. Spread a generous amount of pizza sauce over the dough and add your favorite toppings, such as mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms. Bake the pizza for 12-15 minutes until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned. Remove it from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes, and enjoy a delicious homemade pizza!
